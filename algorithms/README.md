# Algorithms Practice

Implementation of common algorithms in JavaScript with performance analysis.

## Recursion (`03-recursion.js`)
- Basic recursion patterns
- Memoization techniques
- Tree traversal algorithms
- Practice exercises:
  - Factorial calculation
  - Fibonacci sequence
  - Binary search
  - Tree traversals

## Dynamic Programming (`04-dynamic-programming.js`)
- Top-down vs bottom-up approaches
- Classic DP problems:
  - Knapsack problem
  - Coin change
  - Longest common subsequence
- Space optimization techniques

## How to Use
1. Run files directly with Node.js
2. Uncomment test cases to verify implementations
3. Check time/space complexity comments

## Recommended Study Order
1. Master basic recursion
2. Understand memoization
3. Learn DP patterns
4. Practice optimization
